As it stands with 700 praises this equates to ~160 OP per praise on the platform from the previous grant many of which were done by members of the Praise team.

At this point I'd love to see Praise prove a more substantive ROI from the original grant before coming back for more grants from the community treasury.

*This grant would be considerably stronger with 1) a lower request size which could be achieved by substantially lowering the rewards for things like citizenship referrals and claims 2) making a more concrete case why this will continue to drive engagement with Optimism -- as defined by increasing demand for block space. Much of this grant looks like subsidizing a one-off action rather than subsidizing an initial taste of Optimism that then leads to continued use

*Unsure how this grant will drive impact/engagement to DeFi and focuses on only one group of people exclusionary etc.
