 In other words despite Velodrome being the grantee this grant plan would empower Velodrome to unilaterally select someone to receive 10-15k of the grant. That person would then select who receives the remainder. The Grants Council would effectively be funding a grants program run by Velodrome at their discretion making it impossible for the Grants Council to ensure compliance as required under our mandate

 *IMO this is the exact reason that we have grants to help a novel protocol bootstrap liquidity on Optimism.
 

 *Optimism should support a protocol focused on yield-generating collateral
 

 *The grant size is around 20% of the total TVL of this protocol across multiple chains according to DeFi Llama. If the request was smaller -- under 20k -- to finance a pilot to establish this would have a material impact on the protocol's adoption and use on Optimism then a grant would be easier to justify. Notably deployment is a milestone and Optimism is already offered on the Poolside front end

 Also would want to know exactly which LSTs are to receive incentives -- either a discrete list or established guidelines -- so that Compound cannot then leverage this grant to extract concessions or BD deals from LST issuers. 
 

 Additional revisions that would make this stronger if resubmitting:
 1) Pledge to avoid negative interest rates so that Compound users cannot outright profit from fund supplied by Optimism governance
 2) Focus milestones on results (e.g. metrics that indicate users want the thing that was built/deployed/incentivized) rather than team efforts like a deployment

This would itself be a candidate for RPGF imo.

 While some Critical Milestones are metrics based they seem like the ones that are easier to game (referred wallets created could be spam or never be used past creation for example). Recommend a variety of metrics-based milestones in addition to notional volume and wallets created. This can probably be refined with further input from other reviewers if this grant plan advances to the final round though.
